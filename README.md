# LLM-building-a-Large-Language-Model-LLM-
is a comprehensive,  project dedicated to building a Large Language Model (LLM) from the ground up.  It serves as the official code repository to Build a Large Language Model ,  the process of developing, pretraining, finetuning, and aligning a GPT-like LLM using PyTorch.

# LLM 

 building and training large language models (LLMs) 

## Setup

Create a new conda environment and install dependencies:

    conda create -n llm_from_scratch python=3.11
    conda activate llm_from_scratch
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Part 0 — Foundations & Mindset

- 0.1 Understanding the high-level LLM training pipeline (pretraining → finetuning → alignment)  
- 0.2 Hardware & software environment setup (PyTorch, CUDA/Mac, mixed precision, profiling tools)

## Part 1 — Core Transformer Architecture

- 1.1 Positional embeddings (absolute learned vs. sinusoidal)  
- 1.2 Self-attention from first principles (manual computation with a tiny example)  
- 1.3 Building a single attention head in PyTorch  
- 1.4 Multi-head attention (splitting, concatenation, projections)  
- 1.5 Feed-forward networks (MLP layers) — GELU, dimensionality expansion  
- 1.5 Residual connections & LayerNorm  
- 1.6 Stacking into a full Transformer block  

## Part 2 — Training a Tiny LLM

- 2.1 Byte-level tokenization  
- 2.2 Dataset batching & shifting for next-token prediction  
- 2.3 Cross-entropy loss & label shifting  
- 2.4 Training loop from scratch (no Trainer API)  
- 2.5 Sampling: temperature, top-k, top-p  
- 2.6 Evaluating loss on validation set  

## Part 3 — Modernizing the Architecture

- 3.1 RMSNorm (replace LayerNorm, compare gradients & convergence)  
- 3.2 RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings) — theory & code  
- 3.3 SwiGLU activations in MLP  
- 3.4 KV cache for faster inference  
- 3.5 Sliding-window attention & attention sink  
- 3.6 Rolling buffer KV cache for streaming  

## Part 4 — Scaling Up

- 4.1 Switching from byte-level to BPE tokenization  
- 4.2 Gradient accumulation & mixed precision  
- 4.3 Learning rate schedules & warmup  
- 4.4 Checkpointing & resuming  
- 4.5 Logging & visualization (TensorBoard / wandb)  

## Part 5 — Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

- 5.1 MoE theory: expert routing, gating networks, and load balancing  
- 5.2 Implementing MoE layers in PyTorch  
- 5.3 Combining MoE with dense layers for hybrid architectures  

## Part 6 — Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

- 6.1 Instruction dataset formatting (prompt + response)  
- 6.2 Causal LM loss with masked labels  
- 6.3 Curriculum learning for instruction data  
- 6.4 Evaluating outputs against gold responses  

## Part 7 — Reward Modeling

- 7.1 Preference datasets (pairwise rankings)  
- 7.2 Reward model architecture (transformer encoder)  
- 7.3 Loss functions: Bradley–Terry, margin ranking loss  
- 7.4 Sanity checks for reward shaping  

## Part 8 — RLHF with PPO

- 8.1 Policy network: our base LM (from SFT) with a value head for reward prediction  
- 8.2 Reward signal: provided by the reward model trained in Part 7  
- 8.3 PPO objective: balance between maximizing reward and staying close to the SFT policy (KL penalty)  
- 8.4 Training loop: sample prompts → generate completions → score with reward model → optimize policy via PPO  
- 8.5 Logging & stability tricks: reward normalization, KL-controlled rollout length, gradient clipping  

## Part 9 — RLHF with GRPO

- 9.1 Group-relative baseline: multiple completions per prompt, rewards normalized against group mean  
- 9.2 Advantage calculation: (reward – mean reward) per prompt, broadcast to all tokens  
- 9.3 Objective: PPO-style clipped policy loss (no value loss)  
- 9.4 KL regularization: explicit KL(π‖π_ref) penalty term added directly to the loss  
- 9.5 Training loop differences: sample *k* completions per prompt → compute rewards → subtract per-prompt mean → apply GRPO loss with KL penalty
